# ChoreClap

**Idea**

ChoreClap is a platform to make our urban/rural lives more fulfilling to solve our needs in a clap. Hence the name, ChoreClap. It enables users to find any service professional like a plumber, a wedding photographer, a yoga teacher, or an interior designer. We want to be the go-to platform which helps customers complete the projects that are important to their lives â€“ everything from designing their homes to capturing key moments, learning arts, filing taxes, and getting healthier etc.
